# Command Line Commands


## Development

npm run dev
```

## Building

```Shell
npm run build
```

Preps your app for deployment (does not run tests). Optimizes and minifies all files, piping them to the `build` folder.

see your work live!

## Testing

## Unit testing

```Shell
npm test
```

Tests your application with the unit tests specified in the `**/tests/*.js` files
throughout the application.  
All the `test` commands allow an optional `-- [string]` argument to filter
the tests run by Jest. Useful if you need to run a specific test only.

npm test -- Button
```
